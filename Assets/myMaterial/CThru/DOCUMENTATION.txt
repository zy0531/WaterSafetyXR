Setup:

- Import "Mathematics" package into your project
- Add a "Refraction" renderer feature to your URP Renderer asset.
- Under the "settings" dropdown on the renderer feature, set the LayerMask to "TransparentFX".
- On the URP Renderer asset, remove "TransparentFX" from the Opaque and Transparent Layer Masks.
- Set the layer of any objects you use the material on to "TransparentFX".

Please consider leaving a review for the asset as it really helps :)
